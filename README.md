# XSS Scanner

This repository contains a Python script for scanning web pages for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## Overview

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a common vulnerability in web applications, which allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. The XSS Scanner provided here is designed to identify such vulnerabilities in web pages by testing both links and forms.

## Features

- Scans web pages for XSS vulnerabilities.
- Identifies vulnerable links and forms.
- Supports both GET and POST requests.
- Integrates with target web applications for automated scanning.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/example/xss-scanner.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd xss-scanner
   ```

3. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Standalone Usage

1. Import the `Scanner` class from the `xss_scanner.py` script into your Python code.

2. Instantiate the `Scanner` class with the URL of the target website and optionally a list of links to ignore.

3. Use the `run_scanner()` method to start scanning for XSS vulnerabilities.

```python
from xss_scanner import Scanner

# Example usage:
scanner = Scanner(url="https://example.com", ignore_links=["https://example.com/logout"])
scanner.run_scanner()
```

### Integration Example

1. Import the `scanner` module.

2. Define the target URL and links to ignore.

3. Provide login credentials if required.

4. Instantiate the XSS Scanner with the target URL and links to ignore.

5. Perform login if necessary.

6. Start crawling the target website to extract links.

7. Run the XSS scanner to identify vulnerabilities.

```python
import scanner

target_url = "http://192.168.98.236/dvwa/"
links_to_ignore = ["http://192.168.98.236/dvwa/logout.php"]

data_dict = {"username": "admin","password": "password", "Login":"submit"}

vuln_scanner = scanner.Scanner(target_url, links_to_ignore)
vuln_scanner.session.post("http://192.168.98.236/dvwa/login.php", data=data_dict)

vuln_scanner.crawl()
vuln_scanner.run_scanner()
```
